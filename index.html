<h1>Introduction to Information Technology</h1>
<h2>Personal Information</h2>
  
<p>Github: https://s3905546.github.io/COSC2196/index.html</p>
<p>Name: Joeffrey CUMMINGS</p>
<p>Student Number: s3905546</p>
<p>Student Email Address: s3905546@student.rmit.edu.au</p>
 
<p>I am Filipino heritage and having grown up in Sydney, Australia for most of life since the age of six. I can still understand and have some average level language competency in Tagalog and have a strong understanding of the Korean language as I am married to a Korean wife who communicates with our son in her mother tongue.</p>
  <p>I have completed a Diploma in Information Technology, and was an undergraduate of Bachelor of Science, Information Technology but was not able to complete my studies due to focusing on my career, that was over 20 years ago.</p>
  <p>What do I do outside of work? I used to be an avid paddler, paddling and coaching in the sports of dragon boat and have since taken up the sport of outrigger canoe. The heart racing part of outrigger canoe is when you are out in the open waters and your boat tips over and it would take you a good 30 to 45 minutes to tip your boat back, empty the water whilst watching for huge surfs or even sharks, this is quite common in the northern beaches of Sydney.</p>
  <p>When I am not in the water I do enjoy playing a lot of different sports from golf where I get coached to having fun in the ten pin bowling alleys.</p>

  <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
  
  
  <p>I did not get into Information Technology (IT) initially because of personal interest, it came about due to my starting my Diploma in Electrical Engineering where I got exposed to computer related topics such as programming. This then led to my start of interest in IT, I found the challenge and personal satisfaction in programming code to come out with an outcome. At the time, my interest sparked when I was creating a simple calculator in the language of Visual Basics.</p>
  
  <p>Since then, I have been in the field of IT for about 25 years. I joined as a technical phone analyst, when then lead me to joining a large Global Systems Integrator (GSI) performing a similar role supporting their enterprise customers. A year later, I moved to desktop support performing break/fix services to client, I was fortunate enough to move up as technical consulting then was relocated to Japan for 2 years as contract performing IT Management for the region. </p>
  
  <p>Two years later, I returned and joined as midrange engineer, soon after became the team leader then regional manager for eastern Australia for 3 years. I then moved into a solution architect role for 8 years before relocating to Singapore and worked on large complex deals, deal sizes where I was the Solution Executive ranged from $40M to over $1B. I have won large contracts from BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto, AMP to Asia based accounts in Hong Kong, Singapore and Japan. </p>
  
  <p>After nearly 11 years in pre-sales / solution architecture roles I was promoted to run the solution architecture business unit for ASEAN. I then pivoted to Director of Alliances for a magic quadrant leader in all-flash storage then now moved to a cybersecurity company running the partnership with the large GSIs including PwC, Deloitte, EY, Accenture and many more.</p>
  <p>The reason I selected RMIT out of all the available was that I felt it had the best balanced with its strength and high ranking in reducing inequalities. I am also following the university academic ranking and found it is having a good move up the ladder. Personally, I was always curious of what RMIT can offer so here I am in semester one doing the best I can to succeed not only in this course but learn as much as I can from the RMIT professionals.</p>
  <p>By enrolling in this course, I aim to learn and excel in the field of Industry 4.0 where I can step up my learnings in blockchain, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and more importantly in the field of cybersecurity. Hopefully during my journey in doing the program of work I can also meet interesting students, teachers and future innovators. </p>

   <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p>Based on the above building block of creating a data hub with relevant data telemetry gathered from a global network of sources, I believe this can help children and adults suffer from stuttering. If the experiment or project is successful, we would expect the government to help fund some of the research and development of both the applications and the IoT devices. </p>
  <p>Children or adults wearing these IoT devices powered by the global network, both feeding data and receiving data to help synchronise both the neurological and speech motor skills.</p>
